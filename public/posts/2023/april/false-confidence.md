I haven't really shyed away from posting about automated testing on this blog
(see [On Writing Tests](/2022/june/on-writing-tests),
[Snapshot Testing](/2019/march/snapshot-testing), and probably my most popular
post on testing: [Testing Software](/2018/december/testing-software)), however
it's been yet another hot topic on Twitter as of late and I've also been working
with another team recently that has me thinking about weak tests and _false
confidence_.

Many developers that I've worked with have usually leaned on a suite of "weak"
unit tests to build up their confidence in their code and systems. However, more
often than not, this has been false confidence
