I probably don't need to write much more than the title of this post, but this
is more of a reminder to myself that I should not waste as much time as I do on
Twitter or playing video games.

Instead I should just get back to doing fulfilling activities (whether thats
working on side projects, reading a book, hanging out with people, or just being
outside).
