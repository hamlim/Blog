I've found myself copy and pasting the same TypeScript snippet to add
type-safety for `process.env.<X>` references in my various projects. I figured I
should just write a brief blog post to help myself with this in the future.

Use this snippet to override `process.env` types:

```ts
declare namespace NodeJS {
  interface ProcessEnv {
    // Replace `KEY` with your env variables!
    KEY: string;
  }
}
```

### Recipe:

- Create a `types.d.ts` file at the root of the project
- Insert the above snippet
  - Make sure to replace `KEY` with your env variables!
- Add `./types.d.ts` to the `includes` array in `tsconfig.json`
