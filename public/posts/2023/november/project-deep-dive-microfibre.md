I recently started building out a new side project that I am calling _microfibre
ðŸ§¶_, it was started partially to scratch an itch to replace Twitter/X with
something a bit more personal. Additionally, I wanted to build a quick and easy
way to share short updates with my grandparents.

## What is microfibre?

microfibre is essentially a bulletin board, it allows me to post short-form (but
not limited in length) text updates<FootnoteRef id="1" />, which then get
displayed on my personal site under the [feed view](/feed).

It's currently built using Cloudflare wrangler to power the API, Cloudflare D1
as the datastore, and a Next.js app as the posting client (as well as this
Next.js app powering my blog for rendering the feed). There's nothing magical
about the project - it's a fairly basic
<Abbr title="Acronym standing for Create Read Update Delete, often used to describe basic REST APIs">CRUD</Abbr>
API.
