I was talking with my manager the other day about validating my own thinking,
and he shared a remarkably simple note that felt really crucial:

> Just write it down

A good old Google Doc (or Notion page) is such an incredible tool for validating
a line of thinking. It allows you to clarify all the nitty gritty details that
are locked away in your head, and also begin to highlight the areas that you
haven't started to think about yet as well!
