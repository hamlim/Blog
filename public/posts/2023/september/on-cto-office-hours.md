If your technology organization is anything like ours (and it might not be),
you'll find that the recurring CTO Office Hours meet is usually a waste of time.

The questions submitted (either live or ahead of time) are a mix of jabs and
fluff.

The jabs are usually pointed questions, that _never_ get a sufficient answer
during the meeting and the asker usually is asked to follow up directly via DMs
that they usually never actually do.

The fluff are the questions like "When will we get better coffee in the
office?", they somehow become the questions that get the most direct and to the
point answers.

TL;DR: Just skip the meets!
