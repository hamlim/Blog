One of my recent passions that I have dived into since getting my new personal
computer is note taking. I have been bouncing between different platforms and
formats for my notes, but its all in the interest of figuring out how I can
better reflect on my ideas and thoughts later on.

Some of the tools I have been using include:

- This Notebook published on my personal site - most likely the location that
  you are reading this article now
- A running logbook on Dropbox Paper
- A private GitHub repo where I am storing markdown files

Each of these formats I have used slightly differently, and each I use to
collect or share a different idea.

I've been thinking about using my notebook as a digital garden of sorts, a place
where I can share more free-form, less polished content than I would on my
blog[^1].

My logbook on Dropbox Paper I use to mostly track thoughts and highlights from
work, I've been doing this for about 6 months now and I'm hoping that it will
help me prepare better for doing peer reviews as we enter our performance review
cycle.

Finally, the newest addition I have been exploring with has been a private
GitHub repo that I store markdown files within. Each of these files I title with
the date, and I begin typing whatever comes to my mind. I am exploring this as
something like a Zettlekasten of sorts, mostly just a log of thoughts, concepts,
internal monologue.

Through all of this, I am getting better at understanding things worth capturing
and also the things that aren't worth capturing. One of the culminating thoughts
that I have noticed is that note taking is imperfect, it has rough edges, in
many ways it can become like an art.
