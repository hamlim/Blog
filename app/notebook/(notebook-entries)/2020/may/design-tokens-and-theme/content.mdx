Since I’ve learned about the concept of design tokens a few years ago, I’ve
always found myself using both tokens and theme to represent the same concept,
more specifically referring to a collection of tokens as a theme.

However, more recently I have been thinking a bit more about the relationship
between tokens and themes, and I think there may be layers of abstractions
between these two concepts and more directly that tokens might represent only a
small fraction of what makes up a theme.

Fundamentally, the definition of design tokens that I use is that they represent
the collection of atomic values, used to define the visual language of a system.
This is a fairly broad definition, as it doesn’t necessarily indicate the
boundaries of this collection, for example most might agree that a primary brand
color should be defined as a token within a system, but should specifics like
button border radius be defined as its own atomic design token?

This question, that of where are the boundaries of what is a design token has
been what I have been thinking about the most recently.

One of the early explorations in stressing the edges of the design tokens and
theme boundaries has been <TwitterMention>jxnblk</TwitterMention>'s library
styled-system (and its more recent iteration, theme-ui). Specifically, both
library's concept of `variant`'s.
