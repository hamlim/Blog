Recently I've been thinking a bit about the process of learning. I've been
digging into some new things at work and through that I've been noticing that I
haven't really been learning those new technologies.

This could only apply to myself, however I don't think people actually learn new
things, at least not after a certain age. I do think people can get really good
at pattern matching however.
