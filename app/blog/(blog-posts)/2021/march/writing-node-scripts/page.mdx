When I find myself repeatedly making edits to a large number of files, or if I
need to collect some metadata about a collection of files I tend to reach for a
quick and dirty Node script.

Usually I can get by with a `script.js` file written somewhere and then run it
via `node script.js`, however sometimes I want to turn a script into a small
node package that I can install and reference elsewhere.

To accomplish that I usually reach for adding a `package.json` with a `bin`
script entry pointing to the node script.

```json
{
  "name": "my-cool-package",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "bin": {
    "name": "./index.js"
  }
}
```

However, before the traditional node script can be run via `name`, we need to do
two other things to the `index.js` file that the bin command is referencing.

First we need to add a line at the top of the file:

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node
```

In addition to adding that line to the top of the file, we also need to change
the mode of the file, we can do that via:

```sh
chmod u+x index.js
```

For more information, this article on node shell scripting is a great one to
