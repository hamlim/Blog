I've <Link to="/blog/2021/february/useConsole">written a bit about</Link>
developing within what I like to call "fast feedback systems". The core value
proposition of these systems or tools is that I as an engineer should be able to
take a problem statement and begin to better understand it by fast feedback
loops of trial and error experimentation.

Usually these systems look a lot like sandboxes or <abbr title="Read Evaluate Print Loops">REPL's</abbr> not unlike CodeSandbox,
the built-in Node.js REPL, or even the browser dev tools! I heavily use these tools on a day to day basis, they allow me to take a complex
problem and better visualize it through code.
