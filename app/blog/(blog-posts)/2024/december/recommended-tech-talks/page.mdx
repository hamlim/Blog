There's a number of tech talks that I routinely revisit every once and while and also share frequently with others because I think they're so foundational to my career as a web developer. 

I figured I'd write a blog post sharing those talks!

### React Conf 2015 - Hype

Arguably probably my favorite tech talk that I've every watched. It's probably sad to say that I return to watch this every once in a while to have my mind blown!

The magic move demo is still wild to think about!

### Scaling R&D to thousands of people without dedicated QA

This talk really influenced how I thought about building platforms while I worked at Wayfair, and then in every role since then!
