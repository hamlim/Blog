Over the past two or so weeks I've been trying a number of different experiments to setup my ideal React Server Component framework. I've heavily used [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (both in the past and still actively for this blog at the time of writing), however I've wanted to branch out and try a few other solutions in the ecosystem.

However, I still haven't found something that offers the features that I'd really like from a framework. I figured I'd write up some of these thoughts and maybe nerd snipe someone into creating something that provides these features!

### Requirements:

- Supports React Server Components (with Server Side Rendering)
	- There's been a number of discussions around the trade offs with RSC's vs traditional SSR or CSR apps, I feel like there's still enough benefits of RSC's
- Deployable on different runtimes
	- Not limited to Bun (for example), can deploy to Vercel, Cloudflare Workers, traditional serverless platforms, etc
- Flexibility with the underlying server framework (ideally `hono` as a default, but ability to swap it out with something else)


### Features:

- Support for "page" and "route" handlers
- Filesystem based routing:
	- `<path>.(page|route).(ts|tsx|js|jsx)`
		- e.g. `about.page.tsx` renders the `/about` page
	- `@not-found.(page|route).(ts|tsx|js|jsx)` for 404-style routes
	- `@error.(page|route).(ts|tsx|js|jsx)` for 500-style routes
- Access to entire `Request`, `Response`, and `context` (HonoContext) values
	- Either from something like an `AsyncLocalStore` or as arguments/props to the handlers
- Support for Tailwind / bring your own favorite CSS framework


### Example:

I've created (an obviously non-working) codebase showcasing these features, which I suppose could be used as an example by someone if they were to create a framework to support these features!
