A quick
[GitHub search](https://github.com/search?q=unopinionated&type=repositories)
will reveal that there's a lot of libraries and packages out there that brag
about being unopinionated. I think that is a misnomer and instead all these
libraries and packages are just _differently_-opinionated from the
libraries/packages that they are alternatives for.

While it doesn't say so on their site, I feel like the original premise of
[`turborepo`](https://turbo.build/repo) was that it was an unopinionated
monorepo manager. In reality, it just held different opinions about how tasks
should be managed than tools like `nx` or `lerna`.

  If you're looking at adopting some library or package (or even an SaaS application) and one of the main selling points is about it being unopinionated, don't fall for it!
</Callout>

It's fine for a library to express some opinions about how it should be adopted
and how the overall workflow/application in which it is adopted should function.
However, it's false advertising to say that it is unopinionated.
