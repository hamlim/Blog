I don't know if I'll ever publish this blog post, but I figure I should write it
to at least put it down somewhere thats not in my brain.

For the past 4 years out of my 5 year career at Wayfair, I've been a part of our
Design System team called Homebase. I've learned a ton over those past 4 years,
but the most pressing lesson of all has been the pressure that is applied when
working on a semi-platform team.

I refer to it as a semi-platform team because we operate as a platform team in
that we don't directly work on features that Wayfair is traditionally known for
(our customer and supplier experiences), but there are also platform teams
supporting us and the rest of the teams at Wayfair as well, so we sort of fit in
the middle.

Being a team in the middle usually has a lot of benefits with it, we can more
closely draw connections between feature teams and other platform teams, however
it also comes with trade offs.

The core trade off that comes with being a design system team that I've noticed
is what I like to call the squeeze, over time our team needs to both answer to
feature teams and to platform teams, often asking opposing perspectives for us
to support. Balancing those opposing forces can be incredibly draining, and it's
honestly surprising to see myself and a core group of our team stick with it
over these past few years.
