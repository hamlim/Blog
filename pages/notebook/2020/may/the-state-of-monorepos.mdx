Over the past few months I have been experimenting with using a single source
code repository for all of my side projects (including both NPM libraries and
some websites too), through this experience I have seen a ton of rough edges in
the monorepo tooling space.

When I talk about monorepo tooling I am referring to build tools, package
managers, script runners, and everything else in the node toolchain. For the
most part, the common tools in this space are:

- Yarn
- Babel
- Lerna
- Parcel / Webpack

As well as a whole suite of standalone tools like:

- [Preconstruct](https://preconstruct.tools) and
- [Changesets](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets)

Chaining all these tools together can be pretty complicated, and I wouldn't be
surprised to find out that after you do set these all up you have more tools for
contributing to your monorepo than actual packages or workspaces within the
repo.

I've noticed that I was spending more time working on some projects like
[Zaps](https://github.com/hamlim/projects/tree/master/packages/zaps) or local
node scripts within my monorepo than I did work on new projects. Because of
this, I've decided to instead create a template repo on GitHub and moved back to
multiple separate repos.
