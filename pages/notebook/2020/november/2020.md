Whew, it's currently November 28th as I'm starting this post to recap my 2020
(not really sure when I'll finalize this post but going to soft-publish it and
add to it over a few weeks).

2020 has probably been the worst year for me, I'm sure there are a lot of other
folks out there that have had far worse than I have, but for me personally this
has been a really rough year.

### January

To kick it off, I was hospitalized right at the end of January with DKA
(Diabetic Ketoacidosis), coming into the hospital with a blood glucose level of
close to 500 (for those unaware a usual healthy blood glucose level ranges
between 80 and 100).
